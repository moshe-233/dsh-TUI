 * the screen, so a reopen still finds its own snapshot. The map holds channel
 * → rows and never keeps a channel alive on its own.
 *
 * The slot also carries the listing generation, because reloads overlap:
 * `Ctrl+L`, a rename and a delete each re-run the listing, and the previous
 * mount's listing can still be in flight when the screen is reopened. Only the

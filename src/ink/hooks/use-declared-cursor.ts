/**
 * Declares where the terminal cursor should be parked after each frame.
 *
 * Terminal emulators render IME preedit text at the physical cursor
 * position, and screen readers / screen magnifiers track the native
 * cursor — so parking it at the text input's caret makes CJK input
 * appear inline and lets accessibility tools follow the input.
 *
 * Returns a ref callback to attach to the Box that contains the input.
 * The declared (line, column) is interpreted relative to that Box's
 * nodeCache rect (populated by renderNodeToOutput).
 *
 * Timing: Both ref attach and useLayoutEffect declare in React's layout
 * phase — after resetAfterCommit calls scheduleRender. scheduleRender
 * defers onRender via queueMicrotask, so onRender runs AFTER layout
 * effects commit and reads the fresh declaration on the first frame
 * (no one-keystroke lag). Test env uses onImmediateRender (synchronous,
 * no microtask), so tests compensate by calling ink.onRender()
 * explicitly after render.
 * @param options - the declared cursor target: `line` and `column` give the
 *   position relative to the node, `active` controls whether the declaration
 *   is set or cleared. `visible` opts a text input into the native caret;
 *   focus anchors remain hidden unless accessibility mode is enabled.
 *   `hideOnIdle` shows structural focus anchors during movement and hides
 *   them after 500 ms at rest, retaining the terminal's original style.
 * @returns a ref callback to attach to the Box that contains the input.

  //      focus moves opposite to sibling order, the newly-inactive item's
  //      effect runs AFTER the newly-active item's set. Without the node
  //      check it would clobber.

  // re-claims the declaration after another instance's unmount-cleanup or

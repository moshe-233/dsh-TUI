# Configuration

[Documentation index](README.md) · [简体中文](configuration.md)

## Profiles and patch layers

After an npm/profile installation, user configuration lives at:

```text
$DSH_HOME/profiles/dsh-tui/cordis.patch.yml
```

When `DSH_HOME` is unset, it normally defaults to `~/.dsh`. The file is a
top-level YAML array and may use the `!!js` expressions supported by DSH.

Profile startup layers, in order:

- `dsh-base`
- Installed bundles
- The package's `cordis.patch.yml`
- The user patch (applied last)

A user configuration normally overrides an existing row by `id`; use `insert`
only for a genuinely new service.

> When a row is overridden, its `config` block is replaced as a whole. It is
> not deep-merged, so repeat every key that must remain active.

## TUI configuration

On DSH 0.1.7, `/settings` writes plugin Config fields to the active profile's
`cordis.patch.yml`. Older hosts still use `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`; that file is
not the new settings entry point. Language and layout preferences update live;
fullscreen and image previews require `/restart`.

A complete common override looks like this:

```yaml
- id: dsh-tui
  config:
    provider: deepseek-official
    model: deepseek-flash
    # Prefer leaving cwd unset — the default resolves to the git worktree
    # root containing the launch directory. To pin a fixed workspace, use an
    # absolute path (e.g. cwd: /repo/packages/app), NOT `!!js process.cwd()`
    # (that pins the workspace to the launch subdirectory, issue #96).
    effort: max
    activity: true
    activityFrames: moon8
    contextBar: true
    fullscreen: false
    terminalImages: true
    preset: !!js process.env.DSH_TUI_PRESET ?? undefined
    workspace: !!js process.env.DSH_TUI_WORKSPACE_TARGET ?? undefined
    sessionId: !!js process.env.DSH_TUI_RESUME_SESSION ?? undefined
```

| Field | Default/source | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | Harness `agentDefaultModel`; bare compositions fall back to `deepseek-official` | DSH model route; provider and model must both be set to form an explicit route |
| `model` | Harness `agentDefaultModel`; bare compositions fall back to `deepseek-flash` | Startup model; `/model` can switch through a session fork. Precedence: the persisted `/model` choice (`~/.dsh-tui/model.json`, the route the last session ran, whole pair) > a complete `provider`+`model` pair here (deployment default) > the harness default. A half pin (provider or model alone) counts as unset and never merges with half the preference (issue #67) |
| `cwd` | git worktree root containing the launch directory (`process.cwd()` when outside any worktree; a dotfiles repo at `$HOME` does not count) | TUI-side session workspace: agent meta, `@` completion/mention expansion, /resume filtering, statusline; resuming an existing session adopts that session's persisted cwd. Note the bash/fs-policy/sandbox roots are still owned by the composition layer's cordis config (default: the launch directory, governed by dsh-base) and may differ from this session-side cwd |
| `workspace` | unset | Startup workspace target: a local path, `file://` URL, or plugin-provided URI; takes precedence over `cwd` |
| `effort` | normally `max` in the bundle | Reasoning effort applied to every request (validated against the runtime model's levels; invalid levels silently fall back to the adapter default), also shown in the header at startup. Precedence: /settings `effortDefault` (`auto` defers) > the persisted `/effort` choice (`~/.dsh-tui/effort.json`, the level the last session ran on) > this field (deployment default) > the model default |
| `effortDefault` | unset | Default reasoning effort for new sessions (the `/settings` user layer; an explicit value outranks the persisted `/effort` choice); `auto` defers to the persisted choice and `effort`; editable through `/settings` |
| `whale` / `whaleIdle` | `true` / `true` | Header whale and welcome-page idle animation |
| `splashFont` | `daily` | Big-text face on the header splash: `daily` rotates by local date (the default), any other value is a face id (`bold` / `square` / `bevel` / `wide` / `dot` / `stencil` / `classic` / `slab`) pinning that one; an unknown value falls back to `daily`. Also editable through `/settings` |
| `whaleGirl` | `false` | Swap the header's pixel whale for the maid: real raster FIRST (Kitty/Sixel); falls back to the character-art maid without them |
| `minimal` | `false` | Minimal UI (极简界面): reduce header decoration and colors. **A display switch only** — a different thing from the kernel's `minimal` agent preset under `preset` below (that one decides which tools the model can use) |
| `sidePanel.splitEnabled` | `true` (boolean) | Master switch of the split layout: on, `Ctrl+B` and `/panel` open the side column next to the chat; off, neither splits and `/jobs` & co. keep their full-screen panels. Applies immediately |
| `sidePanel.open` | `false` (boolean) | Whether a session opens with the sidebar already expanded; off by default, so the upgrade leaves the layout as it was. An in-session `Ctrl+B` / `/panel toggle` is not written back here. Applies immediately |
| `sidePanel.ratio` | `0.68` (number, 0.1–0.95) | Chat column as a fraction of the content width; while the panel has focus, `+`/`-` nudge it live for the current session (not written back). Applies immediately |
| `sidePanel.panels` | `todo,jobs,agents,info,trajectory,workspace,btw,companion` (comma-separated text) | All eight built-in panels are enabled by default; this controls their ids and order. A well-formed id no panel claims yet stays in the tab bar for a plugin to register later; a malformed entry is refused. The `⤢` on the right edge of the bar blows the active panel up to full screen (drawn only for panels that declare a fullscreen form). Applies immediately |
 | `companion.skin` | `deepy` | Skin of the companion-panel pet: `deepy` (default, the deepy whale kit), `whaleGirl` (the whale-girl sticker pack, 22 animations incl. interaction reactions) or `whale` (the splash's layered pixel whale); the panel is enabled by default and can be changed in `sidePanel.panels`. Applies immediately |
| `btw.contextTurns` | `4` (number, 1–8) | Completed Q/A pairs a `/btw` follow-up carries; older pairs stay in the thread and panel but are not sent. Applies immediately |
| `btw.contextBudget` | `24000` (number, 1000–200000) | Character budget for the recent Q/A pairs a `/btw` follow-up carries; the oldest pairs drop first. Applies immediately |
| `codeFrameStyle` | `light` | Frame of fenced code blocks in replies: `light` is a top label plus a left rail and costs no extra rows; `full` closes the box. Very narrow terminals always use a plain fence. Applies immediately |
| `turnUsageRow` | `false` (boolean) | Show a right-aligned usage row at the end of each turn (tokens in/out, cache, duration, retries); `/tokens`, `/status` and the footer hover report the same numbers either way |
| `modes` | built-in trio | Shift+Tab session-mode cycle (plan/sandbox/approval atom bundles); defaults to default → plan → full-access |
| `upstreamRetry` | `true` | Seed a retry policy (5 attempts, transport-drop-aware failure codes including `STREAM_CLOSED`) on the `llm-pi-ai` provider route the bound session actually uses, whenever it declares no `retryPolicy` — at every bind (boot, `/model` switch, resume), through the official `llm-pi-ai` settings section (the policy the kernel's `llm-retry` plugin executes). Dormant channels are never written; routes with an explicit `retryPolicy` (cordis.yml or hand-edited settings) are never overwritten; `false` opts out entirely |
| `activity` | `true` | Show the live activity row |
| `activityFrames` | `moon8` | Activity animation preset; `/activity` changes it at runtime. A legacy saved value of `claude` is read as `moon8`, and the picker no longer offers that legacy preset |
| `contextBar` | `true` | Segmented context-usage bar below the input box; `false` hides the row. Both this and `/settings → statusBar.contextBar` (also on by default) must be on for it to render |
| `fullscreen` | `true` (factory default since 0.9.0) | `true` uses the alternate screen, app scrolling, and mouse selection; `false` uses inline mode |
| `terminalImages` | `true` | Allow previews in supported terminals; `false` keeps text metadata and skips image probing and preview decoding. Restart to apply changes |
| `preset` | roster default `standard` | Agent preset for new sessions; precedence: `DSH_TUI_PRESET` (this run) > the persisted `/preset` choice > this field (deployment default) > the roster default |
| `sessionId` | unset | Session to resume, normally injected by the Windows `--resume` launcher |
| `backend` | unset (the backend `/kernel` remembers, else `dsh`) | Session backend: the built-in `dsh`, or an installed backend (the experimental `claude` / `codex`, plus plugin backends; case-insensitive). **An unknown or uninstalled value starts on `dsh` with a warning**, never a crash. The profile row reads `DSH_TUI_BACKEND`, which `dsh-tui --backend <id>` sets. See [Claude backend](claude-backend.en.md) |

### Precedence and force-off

- `/settings → Terminal image previews` overrides `config.terminalImages`.
- Without a saved choice, the config value applies and defaults to on.
- Enabling still needs Kitty graphics support and a display mode that allows
  image rendering.
- `DSH_TUI_DISABLE_TERMINAL_IMAGES=1` always forces previews off.
- Disabled previews do not read or decode image data or send image rendering
  commands; sending images to the model is unaffected.
- The checkbox edits the preview preference; an environment override is shown
  separately as “Image previews (forced off)” in the settings list.

### Restart

- This switch is read at startup.
- Use `/restart` after changing it to restart the TUI and resume the current
  session; `/reload` does not apply it.
- If a turn is running, wait for it to finish or stop it with `Ctrl+C` before
  restarting.

## Diagnostic environment variables

The following variables are for diagnostics or experimental terminal
integration. They are all off by default and take effect only when explicitly
set:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DSH_TUI_DEBUG_REPAINTS=1` | Record repaint diagnostics |
| `DSH_TUI_COMMIT_LOG=1` | Record render-commit diagnostics |
| `DSH_TUI_ACCESSIBILITY=1` | Enable accessibility related display paths |
| `DSH_TUI_TMUX_TRUECOLOR=1` | Enable the truecolor detection path in tmux |
| `DSH_TUI_TAB_STATUS=1` | Experimental terminal tab-status opt-in; off by default, with no guarantee of support in every terminal |

Diagnostic output does not change session events or model routing. Enable
only the variable needed for the terminal or rendering issue being
investigated.

## Live activity row

`dsh-working-activity` is installed with the package and inserted by its
patch. The working line reads the plugin's `workingActivity` session
projection, which requires `dsh-working-activity` ≥ 0.5.0 — that release
replaced the old `activity/status` event outlet with the projection, so
older plugin versions produce no working line. Override only the existing
ID when tuning it:

```yaml
- id: working-activity
  config:
    publishIntervalMs: 500
```

Do not insert a second row and do not separately run
`dsh plugin ... add dsh-working-activity` for the same profile.

## Agent presets

Each session composes its model-visible tools and prompt through the official
preset registry: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset-registry` on 0.1.7, or
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets` on older hosts:

| ID | Name | Capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standard` | Standard (default) | Editing, shell, search, skills, planning, goals, subagents, and workflows |
| `ptc` (0.1.2) / `code` (legacy 0.1.1) | PTC | Standard plus the PTC SDK presentation for composing operations in TypeScript; both names resolve compatibly across versions |
| `minimal` | Minimal | Kernel agent preset: a single persistent-shell tool (bash on POSIX, pwsh on Windows), with no compaction, no plan mode and no runtime context. `str_replace_editor` has been opt-in since 0.1.3-alpha.2, so this preset does not include it. The cost is stated up front: no compaction and no tool-result pruning (a long session can hit the context limit, oversized tool output stays in full), and `/compact` plus the questionnaire are unavailable — Help and `/` completion mark the entry, and entering/resuming the preset says so once |
| `cordis` | Creation | Standard plus runtime inspection and plugin-experimentation tools |
| `liangshen` | Liangshen mode | Minimal's minimal tool surface first for root and delegated agents, the full catalog after the first tool call, and a fresh anchor after compaction |

> ⚠️ Do not confuse the 「极简模式」 (Minimal) preset here with `/settings → Appearance → 极简界面`
> (Minimal UI, config key `dsh-tui.minimal`): the preset is a **kernel agent preset** and changes
> which tools the model can see and call, while Minimal UI only trims interface decoration
> (header splash, emoji glyphs, decorative colors, footer fields) and has no effect on capability.

### Selecting and switching

- `/preset` opens the picker.
- `/preset <id>` selects directly; `/preset status` reports the current state.
- Picker names and descriptions come from registry declarations (from
  `preset.yml` on older hosts).
- Under the `en` UI language (`/lang en`), the built-in presets show localized
  English names and descriptions.
- Built-in presets: `standard` / `minimal` / `ptc` (legacy `code`) / `cordis` / `liangshen`;
  custom presets are shown as-is.
- A blank session can switch in place. Once a conversation has started, the
  official blank-only rule stores the choice as the new default for `/new` or
  the next launch.

### Default and precedence

- The default is stored in `~/.dsh-tui/agent-preset.json`.
- Precedence: `DSH_TUI_PRESET` (this run's explicit instruction), then the
  persisted preference, then an explicit `config.preset` (deployment default),
  then the roster default `standard`.
- A legacy `code` preference resolves to `ptc` when the active roster no
  longer provides `code`, then migrates after that successful resolution;
  rc rosters keep their real `code` id, and session logs are never rewritten.
- Resuming a session restores the preset recorded in that session's log and
  does not overwrite it with the current default.

### Liangshen mode

- Liangshen mode ships with dsh-tui. On 0.1.7 it registers with the official
  registry; an existing profile declaration with the same id takes precedence.
  Older hosts install it into the user preset root, preserving unmanaged directories.
- The first-round `bash` on Windows runs an auto-discovered Git Bash, trying
  in order:
  - The installation tree of a `git.exe` found on PATH (covers installer,
    portable, and Scoop layouts; Scoop shims are followed)
  - Conventional install roots and Scoop's conventional directories
  - Bare `bash` on PATH (final fallback)
  - It never accepts the System32 WSL launcher as Git Bash
- Set `DSH_TUI_LIANGSHEN_BASH_PATH` to an absolute `bash.exe` path to pin it.
- The pin is the only candidate; a miss warns and skips registration, exposing
  the full tool catalog on the first round.

### Windows bash tool (winbash)

`presets/winbash.mjs` is a bundled Windows `bash` tool plugin. Mounted at
the host layer it serves **every Agent preset** (unrelated to Liangshen mode; it is not a
`/preset` entry). Its behavior mirrors the official `dsh-tool-bash` — the official bash
executor `dsh-bash-local` is POSIX-only and does not support Windows, hence this plugin.

- Every call runs `bash -c <command>` in a fresh shell; state never persists across calls.
  `description` is required (labels the call in the UI).
- `run_in_background: true` admits the command as a background job and returns the job id
  at once; collect with `job_output`, stop with `job_kill`. No timeout applies in the
  background.
- A foreground command that outlives its timeout keeps running as its background job and
  hands the id back (`promoteOnTimeout`; can be disabled).
- Non-zero exits are reported as `[exit code: N]` markers, not tool errors.
- Compositions without a job registry degrade to foreground-only (timeout kills) and do
  not expose `run_in_background`.
- Git Bash discovery follows the Liangshen chain (see above); set
  `DSH_TUI_WINBASH_BASH_PATH` (legacy name `DSH_TUI_LIANGSHEN_BASH_PATH` still works)
  to pin `bash.exe`.

Mounting: copy `presets/winbash.mjs` into the profile root and append to the
plugin list of `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: windows-bash
  name: './custom-bash.mjs'
  disabled: !!js process.platform !== 'win32'
```

Configuration (the mount row's `config`):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timeoutMs` | `120000` | Default foreground timeout (ms) |
| `maxTimeoutMs` | `600000` | Per-call timeout cap (also the tool-level hard cap with jobs) |
| `maxOutputBytes` | `64000` | Per-stream in-memory output cap |
| `enableRunInBackground` | `true` | Expose the background flag (needs a job registry) |
| `promoteOnTimeout` | `true` | Promote a timed-out foreground call instead of killing it |
| `bashPath` | — | Pin `bash.exe` explicitly (same as the env variable) |

> The Liangshen preset's built-in `custom-bash` registers the same `bash` tool name:
> mount at most one of them per profile. When running the Liangshen preset, set this
> row's `disabled` to `true` (the Liangshen copy is foreground-only).

### Custom presets

On 0.1.7, declare `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` through a profile/bundle with
`id`, `name`, and `plugins` in its config. Migrate old directory presets to
bundles using the upstream workflow; TUI no longer scans directories itself.
Older hosts still discover `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/<name>/agent.cordis.yml`.

Since 0.3, model-side tools, planning, compaction, and delegation are owned by
the preset. Profile mode no longer uses the old `DSH_TUI_COMPACT_RATIO`,
`DSH_TUI_COMPACT_RETAIN`, or the former TUI's subagent-depth customization; configure
those policies in the preset instead.

## MCP

The official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` supports both stdio and streamable
HTTP. Mounted tools are registered as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and enter the
model tool set automatically.

Insert servers in the user `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: mcp-context7
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
      config:
        transport: stdio
        serverName: context7
        command: npx
        args: ['-y', '@upstash/context7-mcp']

    - id: mcp-remote
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
      config:
        transport: streamable-http
        serverName: remote
        url: https://example.com/mcp
        headers:
          Authorization: !!js process.env.MCP_TOKEN
```

Run `/mcp` to inspect connected servers and tool counts. Consult the
[DeepSeek Harness configuration catalog](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/reference/config-catalog#deepseek-ai-dsh-mcp-client)
for the complete field reference.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VISUAL` / `EDITOR` | External editor opened by `Ctrl+G` (`VISUAL` wins; arguments like `code --wait` are allowed; with neither set the TUI prompts you to configure one — no `vi` fallback) |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | Required DeepSeek credential |
| `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` | Override the compatible DeepSeek API endpoint |
| `DSH_HOME` | Harness home (profiles, sessions, credentials, attachments); falls back to the upstream default `~/.dsh` |
| `DSH_TUI_PERSONA` | Override the Agent persona injected by the composition |
| `DSH_TUI_PRESET` | Override the default Agent preset for new sessions |
| `DSH_TUI_THEME` | Pin a built-in (`auto`/`light`/`dark`/`dark-ansi`), static theme, or registered plugin theme ahead of persisted selection |
| `DSH_TUI_DISABLE_MOUSE` | Temporarily disable mouse handling in fullscreen mode |
| `DSH_TUI_DISABLE_TERMINAL_IMAGES` | Set to `1` to force Kitty/Sixel probing, preview reads/decoding, and terminal image rendering off, overriding config and /settings; text metadata remains visible |
| `DSH_TUI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL` | `auto` (default), `kitty`, `sixel`, or `none`; override protocol selection without bypassing the preview preference, disable switch, non-fullscreen, accessibility or multiplexer guards |
| `DSH_TUI_RESUME_SESSION` | Resume a session at startup, normally set by a launcher |
| `DSH_TUI_RESUME_BACKEND` | The backend `DSH_TUI_RESUME_SESSION` was read from; set only when the launcher **derived** the target (a bare `--resume` reading that backend's last session, or the safe-mode retry following the last-run record). When the boot lands on another backend — an uninstalled id falling back to `dsh`, or the remembered kernel when `DSH_TUI_BACKEND` is absent — that target is revoked with a warning. A bare `--resume` request remains and reads the final backend's own last session. An id the user passed explicitly carries no mark and is handed over as it is |
| `DSH_TUI_BACKEND` | Session backend (built-in `dsh` / `claude` / `codex`, or an installed plugin backend), normally set by `dsh-tui --backend`; an uninstalled or misspelled id starts on `dsh` with a warning |
| `DSH_TUI_CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` | Start permission mode of the Claude backend (`default`/`acceptEdits`/`plan`/`dontAsk`/`bypassPermissions`); wins over the mode `/permission` remembered |
| `DSH_TUI_WORKSPACE_TARGET` | Workspace path or URI resolved at startup, normally set by `dsh-tui <target>` |
| `DSH_TUI_SESSION_ROOT` | Override the JSONL session root; profile default `$DSH_HOME/sessions`, bare `cordis.yml` default `~/.dsh-tui/sessions` |
| `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` | Override the non-Windows sandbox policy, such as `workspace-write` or `danger-full-access`; the initial permission plane of this launch, outranking the remembered `/permission` choice |
| `DSH_TUI_WORKSPACE` | Working directory used by the Windows `dsh-tui.cmd` launcher |
| `DSH_TUI_DEBUG` | Enable dsh-tui diagnostics on stderr |
| `DSH_TUI_RENDER_LOG` | File path for raw ANSI frame capture |

The old `CC_TUI_*` and `DSH_CC_*` names come from earlier release naming and
are no longer read as of this release; use the `DSH_TUI_*` prefix.

Two directories are involved and neither substitutes for the other:

- **Harness home**: `$DSH_HOME`, falling back to the upstream default `~/.dsh`.
  Holds profiles, sessions, credentials, and attachments. Early releases pinned
  it to `~/.dsh-cc`.
- **TUI data directory**: `~/.dsh-tui` (a fixed path, independent of
  `$DSH_HOME`). Holds `/model` (persisted at `~/.dsh-tui/model.json`, surviving
  restart and `/new`), `/lang`, `/theme` and similar preferences plus
  `resume.txt`. Early releases wrote these under `$DSH_HOME` instead.

`DSH_TUI_RENDER_LOG` may capture visible prompts, tool arguments, and output.
Do not attach it to a public issue without reviewing and redacting it.

## `/provider`: manage model providers at runtime

`/provider` opens an interactive wizard to add, edit, or delete model
providers without a restart.

- Sources: built-in catalog routes or custom API endpoints.
- Only providers written by the **user settings layer** can be edited or
  deleted; ones inherited from the composition base cannot be removed.
- Keys are written to `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (mode 0600) and render as
  `••••••`.
- Only non-environment keys are written to the store; a key shared with
  another provider is kept on delete.
- Editing the model list re-fetches the candidates: a built-in catalog route
  starts from the installed catalog snapshot and, whenever the route stores a
  baseURL (or the add flow just collected one), also probes
  `GET {baseURL}/models` live with the stored key and merges the listings —
  ids only the endpoint advertises are tagged as new and carry their
  disclosed capacities once enabled; already-enabled models are pre-checked
  and only an explicit un-check removes one. A catalog route without a
  baseURL shows the snapshot only, with the origin noted in the question
  detail. Catalog routes with no single known protocol or custom request
  headers also explain the limitation and stay on the snapshot, rather than
  saving endpoint-only models into an unverifiable profile.

Where it writes:

| Artifact | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Provider profile | `llm-pi-ai.providers.<route>` in the active profile config on 0.1.7, or `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` on older hosts; the route registers on write and unregisters on delete |
| API key | `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (mode 0600), referenced as `<ROUTE>_API_KEY` |

### Built-in subscription OAuth

The standard profile's `dsh-tui-auth` row loads this package's `./oauth`
entry; it **no longer depends on a separate `dsh-auth` plugin package**.
The `/provider` add branch signs in to ChatGPT/Codex (`openai-codex`), Claude
(`anthropic`), or Grok (`xai`) subscriptions. When the installed host's pi-ai
catalog ships the corresponding flows, it also offers OpenAI direct ChatGPT sign-in
(`openai`, using the OpenAI API rather than the legacy Codex backend) and Meta
Muse (`meta`). The primary validated DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` fixture carries pi-ai
`0.87.1`, which includes Meta Muse but not OpenAI direct sign-in.
`/auth status`, `/auth login [provider]`, and `/auth logout <provider>` use
that credential store for these pi-ai routes. Browser authorization tries to open the page
automatically and offers the authorization link and manual callback URL/code
input on one question;
device-code flows show a copyable code while polling. A host without an
interactive question surface refuses sign-in explicitly.

The `dsh-tui-auth` row accepts `providers` (default: all supported flows present
in the installed pi-ai catalog; an explicit non-empty subset must exist in
that catalog), `credentialsFile` (custom file path), and
`modelOverrides.<provider>.<model>` (optional `contextWindow` and `maxTokens`).
A profile override replaces the whole `config` block, so retain every field
you need. The flow implementation comes from the host's `dsh-llm-pi-ai` / pi-ai
installation. Subscription authentication uses its subscription backend; it
is not a general-purpose API key.

The default credential file remains `$DSH_HOME/dsh-auth/credentials.json`
(`~/.dsh/dsh-auth/credentials.json` when `DSH_HOME` is unset), with
`DSH_AUTH_CREDENTIALS` as an override. Existing sign-ins need no migration or
re-login. The `ctx.dshAuth` service name and `dsh-auth` log prefix remain for
compatibility; they do not imply a separate installed package. The file
contains long-lived refresh tokens; directory/file modes are best-effort
0700/0600. OpenAI direct login lazily creates a stable UUID in a sibling
`device-id` file (0600); pi-ai uses it as the installation's agent-host ID.
Status surfaces show only sign-in and expiry metadata. Models appear in the
picker after sign-in. If another `llm-pi-ai` profile already owns the same
provider route, the OAuth route refuses duplicate registration.

### DeepSeek account authorization

DSH `0.2.0-rc.1+` separately provides the Host-owned `deepseekAccount` service
and `deepseek-account` model route. The standard profile includes it in the
same `/provider` account sign-in branch and the `/auth status` and `/login`
lists. You can also run `/auth login deepseek-account` directly, then select
a `deepseek-account` model via `/model`. This is a **different route** from
`deepseek-official`, which still needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. The command
`/auth logout deepseek-account` delegates sign-out to the Host: it removes the Host's local
grant, while the Host handles remote revocation in the background. The TUI
does not implement PKCE, read the account token, or put the grant in the
`dsh-auth/credentials.json` file above. DeepSeek account grants have no pi-ai
token expiry/refresh timestamp, so status surfaces show only signed in/out.
`dsh-tui-auth.config.providers` and `modelOverrides` still control pi-ai
routes only; do not put `deepseek-account` in them.

The browser callback uses the Host `webServer` service. A TUI-only profile's
`dsh-tui-webserver` row listens on `127.0.0.1` with an OS-assigned port; a
mixed Web+TUI profile reuses the official `webserver` row instead of opening a
second listener. If a profile-only update leaves an older global TUI patch
that mounts `dsh-tui-auth` but lacks `dsh-tui-webserver`, the built-in OAuth
entry starts the same official Host listener on `127.0.0.1` at the first
DeepSeek sign-in, using an OS-assigned port. It reuses an existing listener
and closes only its own fallback when the OAuth module unmounts; a declared
but disabled or failed webserver row is not bypassed. The question
panel tries to open the authorization URL and offers the full link plus copy,
reopen, and cancel actions. The DeepSeek flow **requires the callback**; it
has no manual-code fallback. If a remote TUI
uses your local browser over SSH, override `dsh-tui-webserver.port` to a fixed
port and forward that same port (for example,
`ssh -L 43123:127.0.0.1:43123 ...`):

```yaml
- id: dsh-tui-webserver
  config:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 43123
```

In a mixed Web profile, override the official `webserver` row. A stale global
patch cannot apply a fixed-port override to a row it lacks, so SSH users must
also update the global TUI package before forwarding a fixed port. Missing or
unstartable callback listeners fail sign-in clearly without affecting the
other pi-ai OAuth routes.

## Composition constraints

- `user-interaction` normally comes from `dsh-base`. The plugin creates a
  fallback in a bare composition, but the profile patch must not insert a
  duplicate.
- When manually inserting a subagent provider, mount the core `subagent`
  service first.
- A custom `plan-mode` override requires a non-empty `section`.
- Profile mode uses the base JSONL persistence row rooted at the shared
  `~/.dsh/sessions`, allowing TUI and Web to read the same history.
- `cordis.yml` is a bare-composition example and may have a different service
  topology. Normal installation and user overrides should follow
  `cordis.patch.yml`.

`DSH_TUI_SESSION_ROOT` always names a JSONL root. `dsh --profile dsh-tui`
defaults to `$DSH_HOME/sessions` (normally `~/.dsh/sessions/`); direct
`dsh --config cordis.yml` defaults to `~/.dsh-tui/sessions/`.

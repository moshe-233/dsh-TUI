# Contributing

[Documentation index](README.md) · [简体中文](contributing.md)

Thanks for considering contributing to dsh-TUI! This guide is the shared
development contract for humans and coding agents working on `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`.

## How To Contribute

- **Report bugs** through the bug issue form: version, terminal environment,
  and a minimal reproduction. A report does not reserve the implementation or
  authorize a pull request.
- **Request features** in [Discussions Ideas](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI/discussions/new?category=ideas).
  - Issues do not accept feature requests.
  - Accepted proposals get a tracking issue, and its assignee owns the implementation.
  - **Do not start writing code before the proposal is accepted** — OAuth, `/cost`,
    notifications, a plugin API and a remote runtime were each written in full
    and then closed.
  - A discussion, issue, comment, or a claim that a maintainer agreed does not
    authorize a pull request.
- **Open a pull request** only if you have write/admin/maintain on this
  repository, or your GitHub username is listed in
  [`.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS`](../.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS).
  - Unsolicited implementation pull requests from everyone else are closed by
    `pr-gate`, regardless of size, title, test results, or whether a human or
    an agent wrote the code.
  - Maintainers add names based on trusted prior work. It is not an application
    program — do not open an issue or discussion asking to be added.
  - Membership permits a pull request; it grants no write access and does not
    pre-approve feature scope.
  - A write collaborator may reopen a closed pull request as a one-off exception.
    Reopening by anyone else is closed again.
  - Open the pull request against `main`. Keep changes focused: one logical
    change per PR, with a Chinese or bilingual title and a description that
    follows the [PR template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): motivation,
    the shape of the change, and how it was verified. Agents open PRs with
    `.agents/skills/pr`.
  - **A pull request that changes code must link an issue**: add a `Closes #<issue>`
    line to the description, or link it through the Development sidebar. The
    `issue-link` CI group checks this and fails without a link.
  - Changes classified as docs-only by CI are exempt (see path routing under
    Verification). For a maintainer release, revert, or CI hotfix that genuinely
    has no issue to link, apply the `no-issue-needed` label.
- **Run the verification matrix** below before requesting a review; CI runs
  the same commands.
- New features should include or extend a focused regression script.

Before opening an implementation pull request, confirm the authenticated GitHub
account has write access or appears in `.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS`.

- If neither is true, refuse to open the pull request and point at the bug form
  or Discussions.
- A human cannot bypass this with a private approval, an issue link, or a pasted
  maintainer comment.

### Contribution Discipline

Applies to every contributor and coding agent — a baseline of self-discipline
before submission, complementary to the gates and CI:

- **Value over volume**: contribution is measured by substance, not by commit
  count, PR count, or lines of code. No split-up filler submissions; keep
  changes minimal and code lean — do not bloat it with redundant wrappers or
  duplicate implementations.
- **Humans gate AI-written code**: AI-assisted development is allowed, but
  nothing flows into `main` automatically — every change requires human
  review and a human merge decision (the required approving review exists for
  this). Bot reviews such as CodeRabbit are a second pair of eyes, not a
  replacement.
- **Prefer stronger models for AI-assisted work**: vibe coding is allowed, but
  pick the strongest model available: weaker outputs are more prone to bloat,
  hallucinated APIs, and hidden regressions — rework costs more than the
  model difference.
- **Verify locally before opening a PR**: actually run the builds and focused
  regressions for the changed area (see "Verification"), and walk
  terminal-visible changes through the affected flows in a real terminal.
  State plainly what was not run in the PR's Verification section — never
  dress "should pass" as "verified".

### When the gates take effect

The feature proposal flow applies only to pull requests opened on or after
2026-08-24. The pull-request allowlist applies only to pull requests opened
(or reopened) after the gate lands.

- Pull requests already open before that follow the previous rules.
- They are not closed retroactively and need no Discussion or tracking issue.



### Merge queue

Merges into `main` go through [Mergify](https://mergify.com)'s merge queue,
configured in [`.mergify.yml`](../.mergify.yml): a pull request enters the queue
once it has one approving review, and the queue updates it onto the latest
`main`, re-runs CI on a temporary pull request, and merges it when green. The
merge conditions are injected from the ruleset on the base branch (approval,
`ci-gate`, resolved threads, approval of the last push), the same bar as a
manual merge. The queue gives nothing away and offers no path around the
approval requirement; an urgent merge is still `gh pr merge --admin`, which
only an admin can run.

The queue only takes pull requests whose base is `main`: a stacked pull request
is not queued until it is retargeted. An approved pull request you want to hold
back takes the `on hold` label. The temporary pull requests the queue creates
(`mergify/merge-queue/*`) are drafts that run CI once and close; `pr-gate` and
`issue-link` both let them through as bots.

The matching ruleset decision: *Require branches to be up to date before
merging* is off on `main`. It conflicts with the queue — the queue tests a
temporary pull request, so GitHub sees the original one as out of date and
refuses the merge — while testing the merged state on the latest `main` is
exactly what the queue does for you. Approval, `ci-gate` and resolved threads
are still enforced by GitHub, and Mergify is **not** on any bypass list.

## Scope

This file applies to the entire repository. It is the shared development
contract for humans and coding agents working on `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`.

`@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui` is a single-package, ESM-only TypeScript project.
It provides a React terminal UI front door for DeepSeek Harness through Cordis.

- The package owns the TUI, its local command surface, and an Ink/Yoga renderer.
- DeepSeek Harness owns the agent, session, model, tool, skill, persistence,
  and policy domains that the TUI consumes.

Before making a broad change, read `package.json`, the relevant README section,
and every source file being edited. Prefer the repository's existing service
boundaries and helpers over introducing parallel abstractions.

## Repository Map

- `src/index.ts`: public Cordis plugin entry point, configuration schema, and
  lazy handoff to the runtime plugin.
- `src/dsh-adapter/plugin.ts`: TTY validation, service registration, agent creation/resume,
  React tree mounting, and terminal/process teardown.
- `src/dsh-adapter/oauth/`: pi-ai subscription OAuth provider routes, the
  `/auth` command, credential store, and user-questions bridge; DeepSeek
  account authorization delegates to the Host service. Mounted through the
  `src/oauth.ts` subpath entry.
- `src/dsh-adapter/questions-answerer.ts` and `preset-resolution.ts`: isolate
  upstream prerelease dispatch for user questions and agent presets so version
  branches do not spread into bootstrap or channel actions.
  - The questionnaire "provider seat" guard (DUPLICATE_PROVIDER probe + private
    symbol check, #586) only applies to the legacy rc `registerProvider` path.
  - On the 0.1.2 line's `user-questions/request` waterfall, Cordis first
    scope-filters requests carrying an agent; agentless `/auth` requests are
    dispatched without a scope carrier.
  - Under the answerer convention, the first eligible listener that returns
    instead of delegating with `next()` claims the request.
  - Cordis waterfall is around middleware, however: an outer listener can call
    `next()` and then observe, replace, or reject the downstream result, while
    `{ prepend: true }` inserts a listener at the front.
  - Upstream offers no supported way to discover or reserve a verifiably
    exclusive claimant, so the legacy seat guard and its warning cannot be
    reproduced locally.
- `src/dsh-adapter/channel.ts`: the channel entry — the backend-neutral core
  `channel/core/` (binding, input pipeline, shared-projector wiring, host
  seams, `/new`, local actions, files/reports, capability-backed actions)
  plus `channel/extensions.ts`, attached only to a DSH session (the wiring of
  the DSH specialists: rewind, resume, agent view, subagents/jobs,
  model/preset/mode, recap, …).
  - Backend translators turn session events into `AgentEvent`s; the one
    shared projector, `src/channel/projection.ts`, turns those into
    transcript rows. Adding a backend needs no channel code.
- `src/agent/`, `src/channel/`, `src/backends/claude/`, `src/backends/codex/`, `src/dsh-adapter/backend/`:
  the backend-neutral session domain and shared projector, plus each backend's
  translator and session. The structure, the rules and the steps to add a
  backend are in [Agent backends](agent-backend-design.md) (Chinese).
- `src/screens/Chat.tsx`: top-level interaction coordinator. It owns modal
  precedence, global keyboard handling, scroll/search/selection state, slash
  command dispatch, and composition of the chat screen.
- `src/screens/StatusLine.tsx` and `src/screens/StatusMetrics.ts`: terminal
  status presentation and metric derivation.
- `src/components/`: feature components. `components/design-system/` contains
  theme-aware primitives; `components/messages/` contains transcript rows;
  `components/questions/` contains the `ask_user_question` UI.
- `src/ui.ts`: preferred facade for the local renderer, themed `Box`/`Text`,
  hooks, and public TUI primitives.
- `src/ink/`: low-level Ink-based renderer and terminal implementation.
  Treat it as sensitive infrastructure: keep changes focused and accompany
  them with renderer-specific regression coverage.
- `src/native-ts/yoga-layout/`: ported layout engine used by the renderer.
- `src/terminal-utils/`: terminal formatting and presentation helpers.
- `src/*Prefs.ts`, `src/customTheme.ts`, and `src/sessionHistory.ts`: persisted
  user preferences and local session metadata under `~/.dsh-tui`.
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`: project skills for repository maintainers,
  discovered by the DSH filesystem provider and excluded from the npm package.
- `cordis.patch.yml`: package bundle overlay used by profile installation.
  Ordering, row IDs, disabled host rows, and insert/override semantics matter.
- `cordis.yml`: full bare-composition example for direct Cordis/DSH startup.
- `scripts/`: headless regressions, reproduction harnesses, probes, and
  diagnostics. Read each script's header before running it.
- `.github/scripts/pr-intake/`: PR intake gate (locale, close copy, allowlist,
  issue-link). Workflows only orchestrate; `pr-gate.yml` must check out the
  default branch and must not run the PR head.
- `lib/`: ignored JavaScript, declarations, and declaration maps generated from
  `src/` and shipped to npm. `./invariant` uses the compiled
  `lib/types/dsh-adapter/invariant.js` entry as well.
- `README.md` (English, the default front page) and `README_ZH.md` (Chinese):
  the bilingual user documentation. Keep behavior, configuration, shortcuts,
  and limitations synchronized between them.

## Runtime Shape

The central runtime path is:

```text
Cordis config
  -> src/index.ts
  -> src/dsh-adapter/plugin.ts
  -> DSH agent/session services
  -> src/dsh-adapter/channel.ts (core + DSH extensions; AgentEvent -> shared projector -> Channel snapshot)
  -> src/screens/Chat.tsx
  -> src/components/*
  -> src/ui.ts
  -> src/ink/* + Yoga layout
  -> terminal ANSI output
```

Keep ownership in the layer where it belongs:

- Agent/session/tool facts come from DSH services and durable session events.
- Projection belongs in the shared projector `src/channel/projection.ts`; TUI
  actions belong in the channel core (`dsh-adapter/channel/core/`) and the DSH
  extensions (`dsh-adapter/channel/extensions.ts`), not in presentation
  components.
- Interaction modes and key precedence belong in `Chat.tsx` or the focused
  modal/input component.
- Reusable visual behavior belongs in `components/` and theme-aware primitives.
- Terminal protocol, layout, hit-testing, selection, and frame-diff behavior
  belong in `ink/`.

Do not reimplement a DSH domain service in the TUI merely to make a screen
easier to build. Adapt the service through the channel or an existing registry
seam.

## Toolchain

- Supported Node versions are `^22.19 || >=24`; CI uses Node 24.
- CI and publishing use pnpm 11. Use pnpm as the development package manager.
  The `packageManager` field in the root `package.json` is the single source of
  truth for the pnpm version; both CI and corepack read it from there.
- Install a clean checkout with:

  ```sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI.git
  cd dsh-TUI
  pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
  ```

  In an existing checkout, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` first.
  `vendor/dsh-std` is a workspace dependency, so installation fails while that
  submodule is empty.

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the single lockfile. npm consumers do not read a
  dependency's lockfile, so `package-lock.json` has been removed (follow-up of
  #173).
- When intentionally changing dependencies, update `pnpm-lock.yaml` with
  `pnpm add`, inspect the full lockfile diff, and avoid unrelated upgrades.
- Every `@deepseek-ai/*` framework package this package references at runtime
  or from its published types (following `UPSTREAM_BLESSED_PACKAGES`, including
  `@deepseek-ai/schemastery`) is both a peer and a dev dependency.
  - Framework packages are host-provided and resolve at runtime to the host's
    own instance through the `$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules` fallback tree
    (see #198 — declaring them as runtime dependencies lands real copies inside
    the profile and splits module identity from the host).
  - The dev declarations exist only so the package can type-check locally. Add
    new references of this kind to both sections at matching ranges (the
    verify:manifest-deps gate enforces it).
  - Framework packages used only by tests/scripts (e.g. dsh-settings, dsh-tools,
    dsh-session-persistence-*) stay dev-only — do NOT declare peers for them.
  - Non-host packages such as `dsh-working-activity` stay runtime dependencies.
  - Historical exception, now resolved: `dsh-working-activity@0.2.4` and earlier
    pulled a real copy of `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` (plus cosmokit) into the
    profile via its runtime dependency, shadowing the fallback tree.
  - 0.2.5 peer-ified it (working-activity#2), so profiles no longer carry any
    framework copies. Keep the dependency range at `^0.2.6` or above (0.2.6
    also fixes the web-side WorkingLine absent-field guard on unpatched hosts,
    working-activity#5).
- Do not expose, persist, or print credentials. Interactive startup reads
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; diagnostics may report whether it is set but must not
  reveal the complete value.

## Build And Generated Files

The normal build and type-check gate is:

```sh
pnpm build
```

- This removes the complete `lib/` directory, runs `tsc -p tsconfig.json` to
  emit `src/` into `lib/types/`, and then checks the adapter boundary, upstream
  contract, and patch surface.
- The vendored builds that compile depends on (`vendor/dsh-std`,
  `vendor/mathjax-tex-svg`) go through `scripts/build-vendor.mjs`: a target is
  skipped only when its inputs (submodule sources, lockfiles, build command,
  Node version) and every output file match the last successful build byte for
  byte, and rebuilt otherwise; `node scripts/build-vendor.mjs --force` rebuilds
  unconditionally. The fingerprints live in
  `node_modules/.cache/dsh-tui/vendor-build.json`.
- `verify:build` runs every gate in parallel, one per CPU, each under its own
  throwaway HOME, printing each gate's output as one block.
  `pnpm verify:build --jobs 1` (or `DSH_TUI_VERIFY_JOBS=1`) runs them
  serially with live output for debugging a single gate. A gate must not depend
  on state another gate left behind; one that truly needs the machine to itself
  goes into `SERIAL` in `scripts/run-verify-build.mjs`, with the reason.
- The `prepare` lifecycle serves **source-checkout bootstrapping only** (it
  fails fast when the vendored submodules are absent — see scripts/prepare-guard.mjs).
- Git URL dependency installs have been triply blocked since vendoring
  (#308: workspace deps / submodules / pnpm ≥11's prepare allowlist) and are
  unsupported — install the registry package.
- Local and CI workflows use explicit commands instead of depending on whether
  pnpm implicitly runs the root lifecycle.

Rules for generated output:

- Edit `src/`, never `lib/`, to implement behavior.
- After any source change, run `pnpm build`, but do not commit generated files
  from `lib/`.
- Clean compilation removes the complete `lib/` first, so renamed or deleted
  source modules cannot leave stale output behind.
- Run `pnpm verify:package` to ensure every `main`, `types`, `bin`, and `exports`
  target is present in the npm tarball and to smoke-import the main and
  invariant entries.
- Documentation-only, workflow-only, and YAML-only changes do not require a
  rebuild unless they also alter TypeScript inputs.
- Changes limited to ordinary comments and blank lines may skip the local rebuild;
  behavior, type, configuration, or build-input changes are not exempt. This does
  not waive the regressions required below for the changed area; see Verification
  for the applicable checks.
- Git URL installation with `--ignore-scripts` skips `prepare` and is therefore
  unsupported. Registry packages already contain compiled output and do not
  depend on lifecycle scripts running on the consumer's machine.

`scripts/build.sh` is an alternate builder for a local DeepSeek Harness source
checkout. It locates a DSH checkout and rewires dependencies to that checkout.
It is not the default build command for this standalone repository.

## Verification

There is no root `test` or `lint` script. Do not claim that either ran. The
TypeScript build is the universal static gate, followed by focused executable
regressions.

Select local verification by actual impact.

- For documentation and skills, check facts, links, triggers, and conflicting
  instructions.
- For ordinary comments, check the explanation against the implementation and
  confirm that code and types are unchanged, for example with an AST comparison
  that ignores comments. Compiler directives, JSDoc type annotations, and
  build-tool annotations are not ordinary comments.
- For workflow and YAML changes, check syntax and affected configuration contracts.
- Do not add behavior tests for prose edits. Once required checks pass, broaden
  or repeat them only for new changes, failures, or unresolved risks.

CI separately routes changes using the path allowlist in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

- `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`, and comments in source files are outside the
  docs-only exemption and still trigger code gates.
- A local rebuild exemption does not skip CI; preserve required gates and report
  the actual local verification scope.

`verify:build` also checks source hygiene, renderer primitives, the terminal
size source (outside `ink/`, only through `useTerminalSize()`), theme and
activity preference migrations, status animations, table layout, mermaid
diagrams, and side-question behavior.

- Source hygiene rejects the listed naming and compiled-input regressions.
- It is not a source-provenance or license audit.

CI shards each test group by the measured durations in
`scripts/ci-group-timings.json` (every script lands in exactly one shard; the
table only affects balance). New scripts need no table entry; to rebalance, run
the whole group once with `node scripts/run-ci-group.mjs <group> --record-timings`.

For local speed add `--jobs N` (default 1, the same as CI): entries run
concurrently, each with its own throwaway HOME and render log, and each script's
output is printed as one block when it finishes. CI exits with code 2 when `--jobs > 1` is
requested. An entry that fails under
concurrency is re-run once on its own: a pass there is treated as a CPU-contention
flake but still reported (`::error` plus a summary marker); a failure there is a
real failure. `--jobs > 1` cannot be combined with `--record-timings` (timings
under contention are wrong). A typical loop: the focused script for the touched
area (table below), then the affected group with `--jobs 4`, and before merging
`pnpm build` plus the four test groups in full.

CI runs these commands after installation:

```sh
pnpm compile                               # generate a clean runtime
test -f lib/types/index.js
pnpm verify:build                          # build gates without recompiling
pnpm verify:package                        # npm tarball and entry smoke test
node --import tsx/esm scripts/repro-askpanel.tsx
node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-askpanel-layout.tsx
node --import tsx/esm scripts/repro-toolcards.tsx
```

CI test jobs set `DSH_TUI_LANG=zh` as a fallback, but standalone regressions
must not depend on it. When running a script that does not pin yet, prefix
`DSH_TUI_LANG=zh` locally; otherwise a machine with an `en` lang.json or an
`en_US` locale reports false failures. At import time, UI language resolves from
`DSH_TUI_LANG` → `~/.dsh-tui/lang.json` → the OS locale. Scripts asserting or
locating UI copy (including assertions that text is absent) must pin the
matching language: set `process.env.DSH_TUI_LANG = 'zh'` / `'en'` before
dynamic imports; Chinese-copy scripts with static imports should put
`import './lib/default-lang-zh.mjs'` before all other imports. Do not use `??=`
to preserve the host value or choose assertions based on the host language.
Bilingual regressions already calling `setLang` per scenario and tests using
Chinese only as input data (width, clipboard, etc.) need no redundant pin.
`node scripts/verify-regression-language.mjs` (build first; included in the
`channel-ui` CI group) tests locale, saved preference, and environment
overrides opposing each script's expected language, each with a temporary
HOME. This protects both Chinese positive assertions and English negative
assertions. The language fixes in `verify-ime-cursor`, `repro-suggestion-click`,
and `verify-queue` remain, but those scripts run only standalone until their
legacy fixed waits are migrated; they are not included in the CI matrix.
Diagnostic probes are not run wholesale by this regression group; pass `DSH_TUI_LANG=zh`
explicitly when their output needs to be Chinese.

Run all three CI regressions for changes to shared rendering, `Chat`, prompt or
question layout, tool cards, theme primitives, or the Ink core. For a narrow
change, also run the closest focused script:

| Change area | Focused verification |
| --- | --- |
| General headless screen composition | `pnpm smoke` |
| Shared projector, DSH translator | `pnpm verify:projection-golden`, `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-dsh-translate.ts`, `pnpm verify:agent-domain` |
| Claude backend | The matching `scripts/verify-claude-*` (fake SDK, no cost) and `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-backend-channel.ts`; `verify:claude-live`/`verify:claude-headless` drive the real CLI, so run them by hand only when you mean to spend (pinned to haiku) |
| Archive semantics and backend OAuth logout | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-session-archive.tsx` (real headless browser, fake catalog), `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-backend-logout.ts` (real channel/UI facade, fake OAuth host); no native-login/real-credential mutation, preserving DSH/Claude default deletion |
| Native Codex backend | `pnpm verify:codex-contract`, matching fake-app-server/fixture `scripts/verify-codex-*`, `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-backend-channel.ts`; neutral-layer changes also need DSH goldens, Claude comparisons and `verify-agent-event-invariants.ts`. Real `verify-codex-live.ts` / probes must use `codex-cheap-only.mjs`; explicitly list unavailable real ChatGPT login/TTY checks |
| Channel submit/steer/pending behavior | `node scripts/verify-submit.mjs` |
| Rewind/edit/resend and historical inbox cancellation | `pnpm verify:rewind-edit` |
| Prompt queue behavior | `node scripts/verify-queue.mjs` |
| Goal/todo projection and rendering | `node scripts/verify-channel-goal-todo.mjs` and `node scripts/verify-goal-todo.mjs` |
| Compaction and folded transcript rows | `node scripts/verify-compact.mjs` |
| Command capability facts (compaction / plan / questionnaire / pruner routing and the Help + `/` unavailable marking) | `pnpm verify:agent-capabilities` |
| Compaction × session-switch lifecycle (cancel before the fork snapshot, persistence-classified toast) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-compact-switch.tsx` |
| Theme loading, persistence, and runtime plugin seam | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-themes.mjs`, `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-runtime-themes.ts` |
| Default-reasoning-effort and similar preference chains (effortPrefs / settings defaults) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-effort-default.ts` |
| Scrolling/sticky-bottom behavior | `node scripts/verify-scroll.mjs`, `node scripts/verify-resticky.mjs`, and the matching `repro-*` harness |
| Long plan-review body (`exit_plan_mode` windowing + wheel) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-plan-review-scroll.tsx` |
| Fullscreen copy-on-select | `node scripts/verify-copy-on-select.mjs` |
| Component-level mouse drag protocol (target capture, bubbling, click/selection compatibility, interrupted-session cleanup) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-drag-protocol.tsx` |
| Mouse pointer event pipeline (wheel coords/modifier bits, click/hover dispatch, out-of-bounds clamping, pointer-state reset) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-pointer-events.ts` |
| Hover event performance (complete interest boundaries, no-interest rect fast path, frame/multi-root invalidation) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-hover-coalesce.tsx` |
| Prompt-input mouse selection editing (drag/Shift+click/double-click word select, delete/replace, layered Esc, Ctrl+C copy, CJK wide cells, fold-side clamping) | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-input-selection.tsx` |
| Sixel encoding, worker cache, thumbnail/preview lifecycle | `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-terminal-images-sixel.tsx`, `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-sixel-transcript.tsx`; timing comparison `node --import tsx/esm scripts/bench-sixel-encode.tsx` |
| Standalone Markdown nodes (tables, mermaid diagrams) and streaming block spacing | `pnpm verify:table-layout`, `pnpm verify:mermaid-diagram`, `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-streaming-markdown-spacing.tsx` |
| Cross-process session mount ledger (failure behavior, strict reads, lock recovery, reservations) | `pnpm verify:session-mounts` |
| Unsent-draft handoff across screens (snapshot, cursor, image bindings, ownership) | `pnpm verify:composer-draft-handoff`; end-to-end screen switching also `node scripts/verify-session-browser.mjs` |

Most focused scripts invoked with plain `node` import `lib/types/`; run
`pnpm build` first. Scripts that import TypeScript sources declare the
`node --import tsx/esm <script>` form in their header.

- Do not infer the input layer from the file extension.
- `verify-themes.mjs`, for example, imports `src/` through `tsx`.

Regression scripts take their wait primitives from `scripts/lib/term-test.mjs`:
`settled` for wait-then-assert, `settle` for wait-then-act.

- Any fixed `sleep(` that stays must carry a machine-readable tag,
  `固定窗:探针` / `固定窗:墙钟` / `固定窗:pacing` (defined in that file's
  header), in a trailing comment on the same line or in the comment block
  directly above.
- The `verify:fixed-window` gate scans every script registered in
  `scripts/run-ci-group.mjs` and `scripts/verify-regression-language.mjs`
  (including matrix child processes), and fails on an untagged call.
- `固定窗:待迁移` marks pre-existing debt (burn-down tracked in issue #791),
  pinned per file in `scripts/fixed-window.baseline.json`: any file going up
  fails, and old debt going down never offsets it.
- After clearing a site, run `--write-baseline` and commit the rewritten
  baseline alongside. It must not appear in new code.

Some scripts are forensic or interactive tools, not bounded tests. In
particular, heap/leak scripts, PTY probes, replay capture, performance probes,
and `scripts/run.ts` can require a specific OS, terminal, native dependency,
DSH checkout, or long-running process.

- Read the header and prerequisites.
- Do not run every file in `scripts/` as a blanket suite.

For terminal-visible changes, headless assertions are necessary but not always
sufficient.

- When the environment is available, manually exercise the affected flow in
  both inline and fullscreen modes and at a narrow terminal width. Check
  startup, resize, scrolling, input, cancellation, and clean exit.
- Windows ConPTY, tmux, OSC clipboard behavior, and synchronized output have
  distinct paths, so use the matching probe when changing one of them.

`pnpm tui` invokes `scripts/run.ts`, which assumes the package lives inside a
DeepSeek Harness monorepo layout with `apps/cli` and `packages/*`.

- It is not a portable standalone smoke command.
- For an end-user integration check, install the plugin into a DSH profile and
  run `dsh --profile dsh-tui` in a real TTY with the required credentials.

## TypeScript And Style

- The package is ESM. Relative imports in TypeScript use `.js` specifiers,
  for example `import { Chat } from './screens/Chat.js'`. Preserve this rule.
- In repository-authored TypeScript, follow the prevailing style: two-space
  indentation, single quotes, no semicolons, and trailing commas in multiline
  constructs.
  - The Ink-based renderer files under `src/ink` may retain their upstream tabs
    or quoting; do not mass-format them.
- Prefer `import type` for type-only dependencies.
- Do not introduce `any` merely because `tsconfig.json` relaxes
  `noImplicitAny`. Those relaxations exist to compile the Ink-based renderer and
  must not become the quality bar for new application code.
  - Use `unknown` and narrow it, or define a small structural interface at an
    external seam.
- Preserve readonly data where the surrounding API uses it. Keep state
  mutations inside the channel/store implementation rather than mutating
  values from components.
- Keep exported APIs documented with concise JSDoc. Explain contracts and
  non-obvious invariants, not line-by-line mechanics.
- Comments should explain current ownership, ordering, failure causes, or
  compatibility constraints.
  - Reference functions or modules rather than unstable line numbers.
  - Keep issue or regression evidence that explains a tradeoff.
  - Put future ideas in TODOs with explicit conditions instead of describing
    them as existing capabilities, and revisit related comments when behavior
    changes.
- Avoid one-use abstractions and unrelated refactors. Inline a trivial helper
  when it has one call site and does not clarify a real invariant.
- Preserve initialization ordering around environment-sensitive imports.
  `FORCE_COLOR`, `NODE_ENV`, and terminal capability flags are often read at
  module evaluation time; moving an import above their setup can change
  behavior without a type error.
  - Regression scripts that import `lib/types/` directly bypass the package
    entry, so React loads its dev build and structured-clones every component's
    props on each commit.
  - A script that passes large image buffers as props must make
    `lib/types/force-production-react.js` its first import.

## Agent Instructions And Skills

Keep common constraints and task-specific reading pointers in `AGENTS.md`; this
guide owns detailed contracts such as the toolchain and verification matrix.
`.agents/skills/` contains maintainer workflows and is excluded from npm.

- A skill description should say when to use it and distinguish adjacent skills.
  - Keep the body focused on one outcome, the evidence needed to finish, and
    the necessary steps.
  - `AGENTS.md` introduces shared rules; skills should not repeat their content
    or reading reminders.
  - Link additional references only when the task needs them, and say when to
    read them.
- Preserve the user's goal and existing authorization: review, repair, reporting,
  and publishing are different tasks.
  - Ask only for missing information that affects the result.
  - If external data is unavailable, state the gap instead of substituting a
    different task.
- Choose the smallest view that answers the current question: a short call tree
  for ordering, a shallow module tree for ownership, or a focused diff for a change.
  - Plain prose can be sufficient. Use real names and only relevant boundaries;
    diagrams are optional.
- Use examples to clarify ambiguous choices, not to enumerate every case.
  - Allow no findings, unknowns, and short results; avoid mandatory praise,
    empty sections, or fixed lengths.
  - Check whether triggers hijack another task or steps stop already-authorized
    work before it is complete.

## Architectural Invariants

### Cordis Lifecycle And Configuration

- Keep `src/index.ts` as the small public plugin contract and `src/dsh-adapter/plugin.ts`
  as the runtime implementation. Preserve the lazy handoff unless the task
  intentionally changes the plugin-loading contract.
- Register resources through Cordis and clean them up through `ctx.effect` or
  the existing single exit funnel. A render failure must remain loud and
  non-zero; normal exit must restore terminal state before process exit.
- `cordis.patch.yml` is layered over `dsh-base`. Do not duplicate a service row
  that the base already mounts. Distinguish an ID override from an `insert`,
  and preserve ordering when one service depends on another.
- A profile override replaces an entire `config` block. When documentation
  shows an override, include every key that must survive the replacement.
- When adding or renaming a plugin option, update the `Config` interface and
  Schema in `src/index.ts`, its consumption in runtime code, the applicable
  rows in `cordis.patch.yml` and `cordis.yml`, and both READMEs.

### Session And Channel State

- The durable DSH session event log is the transcript source of truth. Rows are
  replayed/projected from events; do not insert optimistic assistant or tool
  facts that can diverge from persistence.
- Preserve event ordering, sequence anchors, and call-ID matching. Rewind,
  resume, folding, tool result association, and exports depend on them.
- Every observable channel mutation must use the appropriate synchronous or
  frame-coalesced emitter so `version` advances and subscribers are notified.
- Keep long-session memory bounded. Do not remove transcript folding, replay
  coalescing, virtualization, or cache limits without a measured replacement.
- Agent changes such as resume, rewind, model switch, and preset switch must
  reset all session-scoped projections together. Audit rows, goals, todos,
  titles, pending messages, metrics, and loaded context for stale state.
- Resolve agent/model/tool/preset capabilities through the mounted DSH
  services and registries. Do not guess external API shapes; inspect the
  installed package types when changing an integration.

### Interaction And Commands

- Keyboard precedence is behavior, not incidental control flow.
  - A focused questionnaire or modal consumes its keys before global handlers.
  - Mouse text selection consumes Escape before rewind/clear behavior.
  - The prompt owns text editing only when no overlay is active.
- Do not hardcode a new shortcut in one component and stop there. Update the
  relevant help UI and both README shortcut tables, and add or extend a
  regression for conflicts with existing modes.
- Local slash commands are declared in `src/commands.ts` and dispatched in
  `Chat.tsx`; registry commands are merged at runtime.
  - When adding a command, update declaration, dispatch, help/documentation,
    the i18n description (`cmd-desc-<name>` in `src/i18n.ts`, zh only — en falls
    back to the declaration), and any related skill mapping together.
- Skill commands stay out of LOCAL_COMMANDS: user-invocable skills discovered by
  DSH are merged from the registry as dispatch commands. Names must be parseable
  kebab-case and must not collide with a local command.
- Keep `ask_user_question` serialized through `QuestionStore`; concurrent
  questions are intentionally presented FIFO and summarized after completion.

### Terminal Rendering

- Prefer themed primitives and hooks exported by `src/ui.ts`. Reach into
  `src/ink/` only for behavior that the facade intentionally does not expose.
- Terminal width is display-cell width, not JavaScript string length. Account
  for ANSI escapes, combining characters, emoji, and East Asian wide glyphs;
  use the repository's width, slicing, wrapping, and ANSI helpers.
- Keep frame output buffered and normal runs quiet. Do not add `console.log` or
  stdout diagnostics while the TUI is active. Use an opt-in stderr/debug path
  such as `DSH_TUI_DEBUG`, or the existing `DSH_TUI_RENDER_LOG` frame capture.
- Preserve raw-mode, cursor, alternate-screen, synchronized-output, mouse,
  focus, and terminal-query cleanup on success, error, interrupt, and teardown.
- Avoid render-time unbounded collections or per-token/per-frame allocations.
  Streaming sessions are long lived, and this repository has explicit
  regressions for prior OOM and scroll-performance failures.
- Layout changes must not allow transcript content to displace the input and
  status line. Exercise resize storms, long unbroken content, streaming rows,
  scrolled-up state, and sticky-bottom restoration when those paths change.
- Keep platform detection narrow. Windows Terminal/ConPTY, WSL, tmux, VS Code,
  and terminals with or without truecolor/DEC 2026 support follow different
  protocol paths.

### Preferences, Themes, And Files

- Follow the existing precedence for configurable preferences: explicit
  deployment config or environment override, then persisted user choice, then
  detected/default value. Document any change to that order.
- Persist user data beneath the existing `~/.dsh-tui` locations. Validate and
  safely parse external JSON; malformed optional state should warn or fall
  back rather than crash the TUI.
- Treat theme names, plugin descriptors, and file contents as untrusted input.
  Preserve path containment checks, plugin ID constraints, activation cleanup,
  and all-or-nothing validation of malformed theme files.
- Keep theme additions complete across the `Theme` contract and every built-in
  palette.
  - Runtime themes must use the `tuiThemes` seam; plugins must not rewrite
    `~/.dsh-tui/themes/` or bypass the managed extension service.
  - Use semantic theme keys in components instead of isolated literal colors.

## Cross-File Change Checklist

| If you change | Keep these in sync |
| --- | --- |
| A /settings setting (new, or changed text) | Written once in `src/settings/definitions.ts` (en/zh label and help, kind, options; keys sorted); the Config schema lives in `src/dsh-adapter/index.ts`, runtime format/parse stays on the field in `src/dsh-adapter/plugin.ts`. `pnpm compile` generates `lib/settings.json`, shipped in the npm package, and the website's settings reference is built from it; `verify:settings` checks the definitions. Until that reference is live, the settings table in `docs/user-guide{,.en}.md` still needs its row |
| Other plugin config or environment behavior | `src/dsh-adapter/index.ts`, runtime consumer, `cordis.patch.yml`, `cordis.yml` (comments: example values and essential semantics only), `README.md`, `README_ZH.md` |
| Slash commands or shortcuts | `src/commands.ts`, `src/screens/Chat.tsx`, help/input components, both READMEs, relevant skill mapping/tests |
| Theme contract, plugin seam, or persisted theme behavior | `src/theme.ts`, `src/themeCatalog.ts`, `src/dsh-adapter/themes.ts`, all palettes, theme provider/picker, custom-theme parser, theme verification, both READMEs, plugin docs |
| Session/channel behavior | Backend-neutral: `src/dsh-adapter/channel/core/`; DSH-only: `channel/extensions.ts` and its specialists; affected UI projections, compiled output, focused channel/replay regression (incl. `verify-backend-channel`, `verify-channel-rollback`) |
| Renderer/layout behavior | `src/ink/` or Yoga source, compiled output, CI regressions, focused scroll/resize/PTY probe |
| Skill discovery or presentation | DSH adapter, slash-command merge, `/skills`, and focused regressions; maintainer-only skills live in `.agents/skills/` and must stay out of npm |
| User-facing documented behavior | Both READMEs, applicable config/help text and bilingual `docs/` pages; a new bundled guide also needs `scripts/guide-sources.mjs` and `guide/dsh-tui-guide/SKILL.md` routing, then `node scripts/build-guide.mjs` / `node scripts/verify-guide.mjs` (do not edit copies by hand) |
| Contribution intake or PR gate | `.mergify.yml`, `docs/contributing.md`, `docs/contributing.en.md`, `.github/workflows/pr-gate.yml`, `.github/scripts/pr-intake/`, `.github/APPROVED_CONTRIBUTORS` |
| Package version or dependency | `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, generated/published artifacts as applicable; do not churn the legacy npm lock incidentally |
| Adding or changing a backend | A new `src/backends/<id>/` (`manifest.ts` + implementation), plus the regenerated `src/dsh-adapter/backends.generated.ts` that `pnpm compile` writes (a checked-in generated file; `verify-backend-registry` fails when it is stale): the build-time index comes from `scripts/gen-backend-index.mjs` — do **not** hand-edit `src/kernelPrefs.ts` or `src/dsh-adapter/backends.ts` (the directory and identity assertions look entries up by id, so a new directory needs no regression sync). The boundary gate derives its vendor-package and `native.<id>` rules from the manifest but compares them verbatim against the `EXPECTED_*` snapshot in `scripts/verify-adapter-boundary.ts`: a backend declaring a non-empty `vendorPackages` or a `nativeKey` must update that snapshot together with `ADAPTER.md` (the gate's failure says so), while declaring neither needs no change. `install` is a declarative recipe instead (`{ executor, specifier, version }`), with the host-side executor table in `src/dsh-adapter/install/` (one value today, `pnpm-profile-add`): the registry derives "can this entry be installed" by looking the name up, the wizard installs the specifier *you* declared, and naming an executor this host does not implement simply means "no install surface" (never a throw). A backend with nothing to add — the ones driving a system CLI — declares nothing. Names come from the manifest (a plugin uses `kind:'literal'`, never the i18n catalog); module-level/process-wide pools declare `unloadExport`, session-scoped resources stay with `session.dispose()`; the `id`, `label` and `install` boundaries are in the "backend manifest" section of `ADAPTER.md`. Register a new backend's focused regressions in `scripts/run-ci-group.mjs`; the registry gate is `scripts/verify-backend-registry.ts`; user-visible values (`--backend`, the config row) go into both READMEs and `docs/configuration{,.en}.md` |
| Claude Agent SDK version | The exact version in both the optional peer and dev entries of `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `src/backends/claude/contract.ts` (`VALIDATED_SDK_VERSION`/`VALIDATED_CLI_VERSIONS`), the install command in `docs/claude-backend{,.en}.md`; `verify:claude-contract` checks they agree |
| Codex protocol/validated version | Regenerate through `scripts/codex-protocol-sync.mjs`, update `src/backends/codex/contract.ts`, method tables/fixtures/redaction/live-replay regressions and bilingual Codex guides; do not add a Codex SDK npm dependency or claim the minimum validates every experimental API |
| Upstream validated-line bump | `src/dsh-adapter/contract.ts`, `src/dsh-adapter/oauth/`, both peer and dev ranges in `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the upstream SHA in the `alpha-compat` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the version constants in `scripts/verify-{alpha-source,patch-surface,web-coexistence,upstream-contract}`, `patch-surface.snapshot.json`, `ADAPTER.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`; steps in the upgrade section of [ADAPTER.md](../ADAPTER.md) |

## Git And Release Safety

- The worktree may contain another person's changes. Inspect `git status` and
  relevant diffs before editing, preserve unrelated changes, and never discard
  work you did not create.
- Do not run destructive cleanup commands such as `git reset --hard`,
  `git checkout .`, or `git clean -fd`. Do not use `git stash` to hide another
  session's work.
- Stage explicit paths only; never use `git add .` or `git add -A` in a shared
  worktree.
- Commit, tag, push, publish, and release actions require user authorization.
  Authorization already given in the conversation remains valid; do not ask again
  at every step. Authorization for one action does not extend to other release actions.
- Publishing is tag-driven. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` requires a `v*`
  tag whose version exactly matches `package.json`, then builds, runs focused
  regressions, and publishes to npm.
  - Treat version changes and tags as release operations, not routine cleanup.
- Release notes credit contributors, and GitHub Releases are not created by
  hand: after npm publish, `publish.yml` creates the tag's Release with notes
  from the GitHub Release Notes API: What's Changed (PR title + author +
  link), New Contributors, and the Full Changelog; `.github/release.yml`
  excludes bots from the generated list. When the Release lacks any asset
  listed in its `SHA256SUMS`, the same run builds and uploads the release
  bundles (a rerun fills them in too).
  - Optional hand-written summary: commit `.github/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`
    before tagging, and the generated notes follow it. Without that file the
    Release carries the generated notes only.
  - The generated notes start with a `<!-- dsh-tui:generated-notes -->`
    marker. If the Release already exists (a rerun, or a maintainer created it
    first), the job updates instead of failing: a body with that marker or a
    `## What's Changed` heading is left alone; any other body gets the
    generated notes appended below it and is never replaced.
  - To backfill notes for an existing tag, run Actions → Publish → Run
    workflow with that tag. It only touches the notes; it skips npm publish
    and bundle builds.
  - In the hand-written summary, every entry ends with `(#PR by @user)` —
    maintainers and external contributors alike.
  - Write bare `#123` and `@user` — GitHub renders them as links.
- Before handing off a code change, inspect `git diff --check`, the source diff,
  the generated diff, and `git status`. Report exactly which verification ran
  and any platform or credential-dependent checks that could not run.
